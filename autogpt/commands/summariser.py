Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/ShutterstockRetail industryCharlotte Tilbury repays £3.2m furlough cash as sales soarCovid crisis drives people online, with such cosmetics sales accounting for two-thirds of total\nCoronavirus – latest updates\nSee all our coronavirus coverage\nSarah Butler@whatbutlersawThu 23 Dec 2021 13.35 GMTLast modified on Fri 24 Dec 2021 05.13 GMTThe celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury’s company has repaid £3.2m in furlough money after sales soared during the pandemic as shoppers switched to buying online.Accounts filed at Companies House also reveal that Tilbury sold her business for £1.3bn – considerably more than the up to £1bn previously thought – to the Spanish cosmetics and fragrance group Puig last year.The scale of the deal means that Tilbury, who personally held a controlling stake in the business of between 50% and 75%, is likely to have received hundreds of millions from the takeover of the company in which she remains a minority shareholder.The London-born makeup artist, who grew up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, also received a consultancy fee of £1.55m from one of the group’s parent companies, Islestarr Holdings, last year, according to Companies House filings.Global sales for Charlotte Tilbury Limited Group rose 11.3% to £258.5m in the year to 31 December 2020, according to figures released by the company, driven by strong performances in key markets including the UK, mainland Europe and Asia.While its stores were forced to close for long periods, the cosmetics group said online sales doubled to account for two-thirds of total sales. Sales were underpinned by online video beauty consultations and a virtual store featuring an avatar of Tilbury, and the firm also continued with new product launches when some rivals held back.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskTilbury’s tips learned from years in the trade, with celebrity clients thought to include Amal Clooney and Penélope Cruz, have helped her build a big social media presence with about 10m followers over various platforms enabling the company to continue to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic.The group fell to a £9.9m loss before tax for the year, after more than £29m in one-off costs related to its buyout by Puig. However, a spokesperson said the company had repaid furlough cash as underlying profits, before one-off costs, interest payments and other adjustments, rose almost 44% to £32m. “We would like to thank the UK government for its support,” the spokesperson said.Alongside Tilbury’s business, Barcelona-based Puig owns brands including Paco Rabanne, Jean Paul Gaultier and Nina Ricci.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryLuxury goods sectorMakeupUK job furlough schemeReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyStaycation boom sees JD Group offer to repay £24m furlough support22 Jun 2022Firms handed £1.3bn in Covid contracts claimed £1m in furlough grants3 Feb 2022Investors fail to block Greencore bonuses amid anger over Covid support28 Jan 2022HMRC boosts efforts to recoup £1bn in suspect Covid payouts17 Nov 20211.6m Britons still on furlough in July as scheme winds down9 Sept 2021UK\xa0furlough scheme enters its final month – should it be extended?31 Aug 2021Britons still on furlough most likely to be arts and creative workers29 Jul 2021Ending furlough scheme too early could damage recovery, say trade unions1 Jul 2021Over £5.5bn of Covid support funds lost to fraud or error5 Nov 2021Ending furlough too soon will wreck post-Covid chances for many firms20 Jun 2021Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\xa0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
